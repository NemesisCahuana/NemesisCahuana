Hi! I'm Mauricio, alias NemesisCahuana. A FrontEnd programmer. I love working with web technologies and creating beautiful and user-friendly interfaces. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some Frameworks like Angular and React.

I like to get involved in all aspects of the project, from aesthetics to functionality, to offer a high quality final product and I am always ready to learn new techniques and new ways to improve my skills. I'm motivated and always ready to take on new challenges.

Apart from programming I am interested in movies, anime, and music mostly rock, metal and indie.
